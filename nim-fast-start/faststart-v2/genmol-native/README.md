# GenMol production-shaped native fast-start lane

Status: native capture and production-shaped H100 qualification completed on
2026-08-18. The fully prewarmed buffered artifact is the selected fast-start
path. The worker remains classified `performance-validation-only`; these
results are performance evidence, not a full agent-compliance release.

## Frozen workload contract

- NIM image:
  `nvcr.io/nim/nvidia/genmol@sha256:139b909a450fe1fb81198214784a15f67e172e766a93a1569827ba5aa05b4541`
- Qualification resource: `computeinstance-e00t12crqg6tw0kz65`, one NVIDIA
  H100, 11 CPUs/120 GiB requested, 12 CPUs/128 GiB limited, and 16 GiB
  memory-backed `/dev/shm`. Unequal requests and limits deliberately produce
  the Burstable cgroup layout required by the UID-bound restore worker.
- NIM cache: `/opt/nim/.cache`, retained source path
  `/snapshots/nim-caches/genmol-h100-v1`.
- Direct artifact: `genmol-native-f7-v1`, version `1`.
- True legacy-buffered candidate: `genmol-native-f7-v2-buffered`, version `1`.
- API route: `/generate`.
- Frozen two-call fixture: `fixtures/requests-qed-logp.json`, 514 bytes,
  SHA-256 `3065261de604f495a2fbae1e7fd92488546ee51f2729e5d40e9be5ee2c22f444`.
- Validator SHA-256:
  `089b4529bd88f0060492699b3c594c6e4557406cd22364e6930d2b44cd588368`.

Every trial performs exactly two POSTs: the retained QED request followed by
the retained LogP request. Their canonical request hashes match the earlier
oracle (`050d9d…fc3b` and `c2ee94…62e1`). A PASS requires HTTP 200, `status:
success`, exactly one nonempty RDKit-parseable SMILES per response, a finite
reported score, QED agreement with RDKit within 0.02, LogP agreement with
RDKit within 0.05, and nonidentical request and response hashes.

The semantic Job is a separate CPU-only Pod submitted before the restore
worker. It reaches only the run-scoped ClusterIP. It uses the exact GenMol NIM
image without requesting a GPU because that immutable image is the retained,
proven source of the required RDKit modules and `/usr/bin/python3`.

## Production-shaped result

`results.json` contains all six counted trial values and evidence hashes. T0 is
recorded immediately before creation of each inert target Pod on an already
provisioned H100 with the NIM/worker images resident and both PVCs attached.
Application readiness is the validator's first successful HTTP readiness
response. Kubernetes Pod Ready is retained only as a separate diagnostic.
Call 1 is the first strict QED inference after readiness and therefore includes
any deferred model/JIT load; call 2 is the immediate strict LogP warm call.

| Storage state (`n=3`) | HTTP ready | Pod Ready | Call 1 | Call 2 | T0 through call 2 | Worker restore |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Direct/O_DIRECT | 48.738868 s | 49.737615 s | 1.186392 s | 0.592471 s | 50.517448 s | 41.219 s |
| Buffered + fully page-resident | **10.548280 s** | 11.558094 s | 1.215907 s | 0.585500 s | **12.348272 s** | **2.933 s** |

The buffered winner is 4.62x faster to application HTTP readiness and 4.09x
faster through the second response. Its 4,781,347,930-byte full pre-read took
6.328907 seconds and occurred before T0. The direct holder also verified and
read every artifact byte outside T0, but CRIU's direct mode bypasses the page
cache; the two rows therefore intentionally describe different, explicit
storage states rather than silently mixing cache conditions.

Every counted trial issued exactly two distinct POSTs and passed both RDKit
descriptor checks. Setup attempts that failed before a valid semantic restore
(invalid initial PVC size, holder permissions, target QoS, and builder source
escaping) are preserved as excluded evidence and do not appear in the table.

## What the old numbers mean

`prior-evidence.json` binds the retained raw sources and their exact hashes.
Each counted run also has immutable `corrected-submit-edge-timings.json`, which
rebases the existing distinct HTTP and Kubernetes timestamps to submit-edge T0.
The prior H100 artifact was `/snapshots/genmol/criu42-h100-warm-v3`, a
4,744,161,151-byte manual hostPID checkpoint. It produced these `n=3` medians:

| Historical path | CRIU | HTTP ready | Through QED + LogP |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Retained page cache | 2.478 s | 3.732 s | 4.831 s |
| Direct I/O, page cache dropped | 35.006 s | 36.508 s | 38.132471 s |
| Cached conventional startup | — | 14.317 s | 15.769 s |

Those results are useful hypotheses only. They were not scheduler-created,
UID-bound native trials and did not start the clock before target creation.
This lane must not label 4.831 seconds—or any other historical number—as its
production-shaped result.

## Native direct and buffered implementation

The donor runs both strict loopback calls before declaring itself ready for a
UID-bound `PodSnapshotContent` capture. The direct holder verifies and reads
every regular artifact file. The buffered builder then:

1. accepts only the exact full-prewarm direct receipt;
2. refuses an existing destination;
3. hard-links every immutable payload file;
4. creates a distinct manifest inode with the new checkpoint identity; and
5. changes exactly `imageIoMode: direct` to `imageIoMode: buffered` before an
   atomic publish.

Both modes used the same image, cache, target resources, request fixture,
worker/tool receipts, node, and `n=3` measurement path. The runner timestamps
demand before creating the inert GPU target, lets Kubernetes schedule it,
binds its live Pod UID/container ID/cgroup/IP/image ID/canonical PodSpec hash,
submits the CPU semantic probe, and then creates the one-shot restore worker.
A mode passed only after three restores and six strict RDKit-checked responses.

## Worker classification

`dynamo/restore-interface.live.json` pins the current integrated
portable-plus-buffered performance worker:

```text
cr.eu-north1.nebius.cloud/e00ffw8yqnrrd507t9/archvteams-2407-k301ud/snapshot-agent@sha256:d5ce1eaad55378a93a9bf53b35effcbc378ed15ab7e5b7f6b41df6689cefdf28
```

It pins restore-worker SHA-256
`941157dd1815acf6f3e26cbe9dea65ee1c9a398c719881d474e5d7c5c7e28651`
and 34-file tool-manifest SHA-256
`c0d638100c03fa35973e82859d15b9c8dd1bcbf0fe9cb185b58cc21fae7ead1e`.
The exact eight-patch worker supports direct, writeback, and buffered image
I/O, with `ns-bind-mount` built against the Jammy/GLIBC-2.35 runtime.

It is still classified `performance-validation-only`: the exact Jammy CUDA
base lacks the required baseline SBOM in the pinned compliance corpus.
Therefore `release_ready` remains `false`. Live qualification required the
explicit `--allow-performance-validation-worker` acknowledgement on both the
capture renderer and trial runner; the unacknowledged path still fails before
any Kubernetes command. A production release still requires an immutable
full-compliance image and receipts, formal approval, classification
`full-agent-compliance-release`, an empty blocker, and `release_ready: true`.
