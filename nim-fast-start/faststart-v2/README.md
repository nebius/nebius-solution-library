# BioNeMo NIM fast start v2

This subtree contains production-shaped n=3 results for OpenFold2, Boltz2,
ProteinMPNN, DiffDock, OpenFold3, MSA Search, GenMol, RFdiffusion, and MolMIM.
OpenFold2, Boltz2, ProteinMPNN, DiffDock, OpenFold3, MSA Search, GenMol,
RFdiffusion, and MolMIM retain exact T0-to-second-response boundaries.
Evo2-40B is the only remaining non-production-shaped row and remains blocked
on release of the only allowed H200 from an owner-managed Deployment. The
shared metric contract and current ten-model matrix are in
`performance/COLD_START_METRICS.md`. The completed stable-lane
response-boundary audit is recorded in
`performance/RESPONSE_BOUNDARY_REQUALIFICATION.md`:

- `native-capture/` creates the qualified native Dynamo artifact;
- `phase2-agent/` reproduces the generic one-shot restore-worker image;
- `dynamo/` renders and validates target, binding, restore, semantic probe, and
  derived evidence objects, and provides the explicit provisioned-node runner;
  and
- `performance/openfold2/` records the corrected provisioned-node
  response-boundary n=3 result without storing raw cluster evidence or
  credentials in Git;
- `performance/cost-ledger/` builds a fail-closed resource-usage ledger and
  joins only explicit, effective-dated price snapshots; latency remains
  distinct from billed cost;
- `openfold2-newnode/` contains the archived scale-from-zero preemptible-node
  harness, lifecycle verifier, automated node bootstrap, and two historical
  lifecycle results. Both remain useful operational evidence but contribute
  zero samples to the current complete-response metric;
- `boltz2-native/` contains the Boltz2 capture inputs, strict validator,
  model adapter, provisioned-node runner, corrected response-boundary n=3
  result, and rejected writeback comparison;
- `proteinmpnn-native/` contains the ProteinMPNN capture inputs, strict
  validator, exact response-boundary runner, direct-I/O comparator, and winning
  fully prewarmed buffered n=3 result. The selected route reaches HTTP
  readiness in 9.460347 seconds and the second complete response in 10.249097
  seconds from T0;
- `diffdock-native/` contains the DiffDock capture inputs, strict 1UBQ+aspirin
  validator, direct canary, and winning fully prewarmed buffered
  response-boundary n=3 result. The selected route reaches HTTP readiness in
  12.127239 seconds and the second complete response in 14.190621 seconds from
  T0;
- `openfold3-native/` contains the completed native capture, direct canary, and
  winning fully prewarmed buffered response-boundary n=3 result. The selected
  route reaches HTTP readiness in 12.271182 seconds and the second complete
  response in 30.564921 seconds from T0;
- `msa-search-native/` contains the selected cache-attached, fully prewarmed
  conventional response-boundary n=3 result plus the excluded
  topology-mismatched native capture. The selected route reaches HTTP
  readiness in 4.872400 seconds and the second complete response in 4.942788
  seconds from T0;
- `evo2-native/` pins the exact Evo2 image and single-H200 profile, native
  capture workflow, direct/buffered artifact candidates, early external
  two-call semantic probe, and n=3 runner. Capture requires explicit owner
  authorization and temporary release of the H200; live qualification remains
  deferred;
- `genmol-native/` contains the completed native capture, strict RDKit QED/LogP
  two-call contract, direct n=3 comparator, and winning fully prewarmed
  buffered response-boundary n=3 result. The selected route reaches HTTP
  readiness in 10.400351 seconds and the second complete response in
  12.177434 seconds from T0. Historical page-cache timings remain
  non-production-shaped comparators;
- `rfdiffusion-native/` contains the strict native capture, exact direct
  canary, and selected refreshed fully prewarmed buffered n=3 result. The
  selected route reaches HTTP readiness in 17.662044 seconds and the second
  complete response in 31.379359 seconds from T0; and
- `molmim-native/` contains the exact-image conventional control and completed
  buffered/direct native comparison. The selected buffered native n=3 result
  reaches HTTP readiness in 10.520799 seconds and the second complete response
  in 15.431630 seconds from T0.

All renderer and verifier entry points are offline. Live work requires an
explicit invocation of either `dynamo/run_provisioned_trial.sh` or
one of the model-specific provisioned-node runners.

## Public configuration

This public tree replaces the environment-specific project, cluster,
node-group, compute-node, API-server, registry, and local-home coordinates.
The following values are deliberately non-routable examples and must be
replaced or supplied by the operator before a live benchmark:

- `project-example`, `mk8scluster-example`, and `mk8snodegroup-example` stand
  for operator-owned Nebius resource IDs.
- `https://kubernetes-api.example.invalid:443` stands for the exact API server
  expected in the selected kubeconfig. Provisioned runners accept an override
  through `EXPECTED_API_SERVER`.
- `gpu-node-*.example.invalid` and `h200-node.example.invalid` are fixture node
  names. Runners that expose `TARGET_NODE` accept the operator's selected node;
  frozen manifests and qualification receipts must be regenerated together for
  a different node.
- `registry.example.invalid/faststart` and
  `registry.example.invalid/upstream` replace private registry coordinates.
  The immutable image digests are retained so a mirrored image can still be
  checked byte-for-byte.
- `<private-evidence-root>` marks local evidence that was intentionally not
  committed. Result timings, storage sizes, sample counts, and public-safe
  receipt hashes remain in Git.

The OpenFold2 new-node harness additionally requires
`OPENFOLD2_EVIDENCE_ROOT`, `KUBECONFIG`, `OPENFOLD2_CLUSTER_ID`,
`OPENFOLD2_PROJECT_ID`, `OPENFOLD2_NODE_GROUP_ID`, `OPENFOLD2_KUBE_CONTEXT`,
`OPENFOLD2_HOLDER_NODE`, `OPENFOLD2_ARTIFACT_PV`, `OPENFOLD2_CACHE_PV`,
`NEBIUS_PROFILE`, and `EXPECTED_API_SERVER`.
The Boltz2 native runner requires `BOLTZ2_EVIDENCE_ROOT`, `KUBECONFIG`,
`TARGET_NODE`, and `EXPECTED_API_SERVER`. These inputs are read at runtime and
are not stored in the repository.
The DiffDock response-boundary cohort runner additionally accepts
`EXPECTED_CONTEXT`, `TARGET_NODE`, `DIFFDOCK_ARTIFACT_HOLDER`,
`DIFFDOCK_ARTIFACT_PVC`, `DIFFDOCK_CACHE_PVC`, `DIFFDOCK_NGC_PULL_SECRET`,
and `DIFFDOCK_WORKER_PULL_SECRET`; its checked-in defaults are non-routable
examples.

Files named `restore-interface.live.json` are sanitized qualification
receipts, despite the historical filename. Their public registry coordinates
are examples; regenerate and re-review a receipt after mirroring its pinned
images rather than treating the checked-in path as deployable.
