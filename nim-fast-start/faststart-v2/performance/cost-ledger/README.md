# Fail-closed usage and cost ledger

This directory turns explicit resource receipts into auditable **usage**, then
optionally joins an explicit price snapshot. It never queries a provider,
discovers prices, or substitutes a guessed price. The example therefore remains
`INCOMPLETE`: every unavailable `currency`, `unit_price`, `amount`, and total is
`null`.

## Boundary and accounting contract

`build_usage_ledger.py` consumes one or more
`faststart-usage-receipt/v1` JSON files and emits a
`faststart-usage-ledger/v1` document governed by
`usage-ledger.schema.json`. Each receipt must explicitly declare every attempt,
its outcome, and absolute UTC timestamps. Counts are assertions: omitting a
failed attempt while retaining a larger declared count is rejected. Each failed
attempt also needs a `failed_attempt` resource interval from its T0 through its
failure timestamp.

Resource intervals are partitioned into:

- `node_provision`: creation request through usable node capacity;
- `pre_t0_setup`: setup before the measured target create, including explicit
  image/cache preparation when it is in the accounting scope;
- `gpu_critical_path`: T0 immediately before target create through the complete
  second semantic response. Its absolute boundaries must equal the attempt
  timestamps;
- `cleanup`: resource-retaining cleanup after an attempt;
- `idle_retained`: attached/provisioned capacity not doing setup or an attempt;
  this is the only phase allowed to have `end_at: null`; and
- `failed_attempt`: T0 through the explicit failure observation.

The phases are workload phases and may be recorded for multiple meters (for
example node-seconds and GPU-seconds). `resource_id` identifies one billable
meter, so a node and its GPU need distinct IDs. A repeated resource ID is
accepted only when every copy says `shared: true` and has the same type, SKU,
unit, quantity, and lifecycle. `allocated_at` and nullable `released_at` bound
that lifecycle. Intervals must cover it contiguously: a gap must be represented
as `idle_retained`, the first interval must start at allocation, and the last
must end at release. An unreleased resource must therefore end in an open idle
interval. Identical shared interval observations are deduplicated and retain all
source receipt IDs. A non-identical overlap is rejected as ambiguous
double-counting. Open intervals remain open with null duration and usage; they
are never clipped to build time. Only create separate node/GPU meters when the
provider bills them separately; do not split one bundled charge into aliases.

All quantities and derived seconds are plain decimal strings. JSON binary
floats, exponents, negative quantities or intervals, nonmonotonic
milestones, overlapping resource intervals, unsupported/mismatched units, and
unaccounted successful or failed attempts fail closed. Integers are used only
for counts.

## What the current exact metrics mean

The exact warm-provisioned results in `../COLD_START_METRICS.md` provide attempt
milestones, not a bill. The mapping is:

| Existing metric | Ledger derivation | Cost interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP readiness | `t0_at` to `http_ready_at` | Latency only; it does not reveal how long a pre-existing node, GPU, or attached volume was retained. |
| First inference call (including deferred model load) | `call1_dispatched_at` to `call1_response_received_at` | Latency inside the critical path, not independently billable usage. |
| Second warm inference call | `call2_dispatched_at` to `call2_response_received_at` | Latency inside the critical path, not independently billable usage. |
| Exact total | `t0_at` to `call2_response_received_at` | Boundary for `gpu_critical_path`; resource quantity and the provider's actual billing meter are still required. |
| Validation completion | second response to `validation_completed_at` | Retained as `validation_tail`; excluded from exact total and not silently added to usage. Explicit resource receipts decide whether this time is critical, cleanup, or idle. |

Consequently, the current latency matrix can seed absolute attempt intervals but
cannot be presented as billed cost. Warm provisioned-node time before T0,
storage retention, node provisioning, cleanup, idle capacity, failed attempts,
billing increments, and authoritative effective-dated prices are separate
evidence.

## Receipt shape and commands

Each receipt has exactly five top-level fields: `schema_version` with value
`faststart-usage-receipt/v1`, a unique `receipt_id`, `run`, `attempts`, and
`resources`. The run declares its ID, model, measurement class, observation
window, and total/success/failure counts. A complete runnable example, including
a success, an explicit failure, attached storage, all six phases, and an open
retained interval, is in `examples/receipt.json`.
Build and validate without network access:

```bash
python3 build_usage_ledger.py \
  --receipt examples/receipt.json \
  --output examples/usage-ledger.json
python3 validate_usage_ledger.py examples/usage-ledger.json
```

## Explicit price join

`join_price_snapshot.py` is intentionally separate. A
`faststart-price-snapshot/v1` file must contain a price record for every
resource SKU and exact usage unit. Every record must explicitly carry
`effective_from` and `effective_to` (`null` means open-ended). The selected
record must cover the entire absolute resource interval; price changes are not
silently split or extrapolated. Overlapping records for the same SKU/unit are
rejected.

An `AVAILABLE` price requires a plain Decimal `unit_price`, currency, and source.
An `UNAVAILABLE` price requires null currency and unit price. Any unavailable
price or open usage interval makes the ledger total `INCOMPLETE`, with total
currency and value null. The joiner retains per-interval price provenance and
uses `decimal.Decimal` for multiplication and summation.

```bash
python3 join_price_snapshot.py \
  --ledger examples/usage-ledger.json \
  --price-snapshot examples/price-snapshot-unavailable.json \
  --output examples/usage-ledger-unavailable-cost.json
python3 validate_usage_ledger.py examples/usage-ledger-unavailable-cost.json
```

The checked-in unavailable snapshot is a contract example, not a price source.
No currency amount in it was fetched or inferred.

Run the focused tests with:

```bash
python3 -m unittest -v test_cost_ledger.py
```
